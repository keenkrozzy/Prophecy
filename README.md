## Prophecy 
#### RimWorld Alpha 17

Changing different parts of the game for the love of coding.

### Features I am currently working on

- Main Menu rehual
- Custom new game process

### Notes

Arid shrublands has place-holder apparel while I test some things. Still need to make Classes to handle item generation.
